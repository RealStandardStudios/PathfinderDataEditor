Ring Name	Aura	Caster Level	Price	Description	Construction
Ring of animal friendship	faint enchantment	3rd	10,800 gp	A ring of animal friendship always bears some sort of animal-like design in its craftsmanship. On command, this ring affects an animal as if the wearer had cast charm animal.	Forge Ring, charm animal; Cost 5,400 gp
Ring of blinking	moderate transmutation	7th	27,000 gp	On command, this ring makes the wearer blink, as the blink spell.	Forge Ring, blink; Cost 13,500 gp
Ring of charmeleon power	faint illusion	3rd	12,700 gp	As a free action, the wearer of this ring can gain the ability to magically blend in with the surroundings. This provides a +10 competence bonus on herStealth checks. As a standard action, she can also use the spell disguise self as often as she wants.	Forge Ring, disguise self, invisibility; Cost 6,350 gp
Ring of Climbing	faint transmutation	5th	2,500 gp	This ring is actually a magic leather cord that ties around a finger. It continually grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Climb checks.	Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in the Climb skill; Cost 1,250 gp
Ring of Climbing, inproved	faint transmutation	5th	10,000 gp	As a ring of climbing, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer's Climb checks.	Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks in the Climb skill; Cost 5,000 gp
Ring of Counterspells	moderate evocation	11th	4,000 gp	This ring might seem to be a ring of spell storing upon first examination. However, while it allows a single spell of 1st through 6th level to be cast into it, that spell cannot be cast out of the ring again. Instead, should that spell ever be cast upon the wearer, the spell is immediately countered, as a counterspell action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer's part. Once so used, the spell cast within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as before) may be placed into it again.	Forge Ring, imbue with spell ability; Cost 2,000 gp
Ring of Djinni calling	strong conjuration	17th	125,000 gp	One of the many rings of fable, this “genie” ring is useful indeed. It serves as a special gate by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the Plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless.	Forge Ring, gate; Cost 62,500 gp
Ring of Elemental Command	strong conjuration	15th	200,000 gp	All four kinds of elemental command rings are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties.  Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of him. If the wearer desires, he may forego this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.  Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned who attack the wearer take a –1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. He gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapon he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.  The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which his ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that he wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if he is strong. If he is weak, they hate and desire to slay him.  The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows:  Element        Saving Throw Penalty Air        –2 against earth-based effects Earth        –2 against air- or electricity-based effects Fire        –2 against water- or cold-based effects Water        –2 against fire-based effects In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind.  Ring of Elemental Command (Air)  Feather fall (unlimited use, wearer only) Resist energy (electricity) (unlimited use, wearer only) Gust of wind (twice per day) Wind wall (unlimited use) Air walk (once per day, wearer only) Chain lightning (once per week) The ring appears to be a ring of feather falling until a certain condition is met to activate its full potential. It must be reactivated each time a new wearer acquires it.  Ring of Elemental Command (Earth)  Meld into stone (unlimited use, wearer only) Soften earth and stone (unlimited use) Stone shape (twice per day) Stoneskin (once per week, wearer only) Passwall (twice per week) Wall of stone (once per day) The ring appears to be a ring of meld into stone (allowing the wearer to cast meld into stone at will) until the established condition is met.  Ring of Elemental Command (Fire)  Resist energy (fire) (as a major ring of energy resistance [fire]) Burning hands (unlimited use) Flaming sphere (twice per day) Pyrotechnics (twice per day) Wall of fire (once per day) Flame strike (twice per week) The ring appears to be a major ring of energy resistance (fire) until the established condition is met.  Ring of Elemental Command (Water)  Water walk (unlimited use) Create water (unlimited use) Water breathing (unlimited use) Wall of ice (once per day) Ice storm (twice per week) Control water (twice per week) The ring appears to be a ring of water walking until the established condition is met.	Forge Ring, summon monster VI, all appropriate spells; Cost 100,000 gp
Ring of Energy Restance	faint (minor) or moderate (major or greater) abjuration	3rd (minor), 7th (major), or 11th (greater)	12,000 gp (minor), 28,000 gp (major), 44,000 gp (greater)	This ring continually protects the wearer from damage from one type of energy—acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic (chosen by the creator of the item; determine randomly if found as part of a treasure hoard). Each time the wearer would normally take such damage, subtract the ring's resistance value from the damage dealt. A minor ring of energy resistance grants 10 points of resistance. A major ring of energy resistance grants 20 points of resistance. A greater ring of energy resistance grants 30 points of resistance.	Forge Ring, resist energy; Cost 6,000 gp (minor), 14,000 gp (major), 22,000 gp (greater)
Ring of Evasion	moderate transmutation	7th	25,000 gp	This ring continually grants the wearer the ability to avoid damage as if she had evasion. Whenever she makes a Reflex saving throw to determine whether she takes half damage, a successful save results in no damage.	Forge Ring, jump; Cost 12,500 gp
Ring of Feather Falling	faint transmutation	1st	2,200 gp	This ring is crafted with a feather pattern all around its edge. It acts exactly like a feather fall spell, activated immediately if the wearer falls more than 5 feet.	Forge Ring, feather fall; Cost 1,100 gp
Ring of Force Shield	moderate evocation	9th	8,500 gp	An iron band, this simple ring generates a shield-sized (and shield-shaped) wall of force that stays with the ring and can be wielded by the wearer as if it were a heavy shield (+2 AC). This special creation has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance since it is weightless and encumbrance-free. Itcan be activated and deactivated at will as a free action.	Forge Ring, wall of force; Cost 4,250 gp
Ring of Freedon of Movement	moderate abjuration	7th	40,000 gp	This gold ring allows the wearer to act as if continually under the effect of a freedom of movement spell.	Forge Ring, freedom of movement; Cost 20,000 gp
Ring of Friend Shield	moderate abjuration	10th	50,000 gp	These curious rings always come in pairs. A friend shield ring without its mate is useless. Either wearer of one of a pair of the rings can, at any time, command his ring to cast a shield other spell with the wearer of the mated ring as the recipient. This effect has no range limitation.	Forge Ring, shield other; Cost 25,000 gp
Ring of Invisibility	faint illusion	3rd	20,000 gp	By activating this simple silver ring, the wearer can benefit from invisibility, as the spell.	Forge Ring, invisibility; Cost 10,000 gp
Ring of Jumping	faint transmutation	2nd	2,500 gp	This ring continually allows the wearer to leap about, providing a +5 competence bonus on all his Acrobatics checks made to make high or long jumps.	Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in the Acrobatics skill; Cost 1,250 gp
Ring of jumping, Inproved	moderate transmutation	7th	10,000 gp	As a ring of jumping, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer's Acrobatics checks made to make high or long jumps.	Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks in the Acrobatics skill; Cost 5,000 gp
Ring of Mind Shielding	faint abjuration	3rd	8,000 gp	This ring is usually of fine workmanship and wrought from heavy gold. The wearer is continually immune to detect thoughts, discern lies, and any attempt to magically discern her alignment.	Forge Ring, nondetection; Cost 4,000 gp
Ring of Protection	faint abjuration	5th	2,000 gp (+1), 8,000 gp (+2), 18,000 gp (+3), 32,000 gp (+4), 50,000 gp (+5)	This ring offers continual magical protection in the form of a deflection bonus of +1 to +5 to AC.	Forge Ring, shield of faith, caster must be of a level at least three times the bonus of the ring; Cost 1,000 gp (+1), 4,000 gp (+2), 9,000 gp (+3), 16,000 gp (+4), 25,000 gp (+5)
Ring of the Ram	moderate transmutation	9th	8,600 gp	The ring of the ram is an ornate ring forged of hard metal, usually iron or an iron alloy. It has the head of a ram as its device. The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ram-like force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance. The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. The ram is Large and uses the ring's caster level as its base attack bonus with a Strength of 25. This gives the ram a Combat Maneuver Bonus of +17. The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended. In addition to its attack mode, the ring of the ram also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with Strength 25. This expends 1 charge. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength 29. A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.	Forge Ring, bull's strength, telekinesis; Cost 4,300 gp
Ring of Regeneration	strong conjuration	15th	90,000 gp	This white gold ring is generally set with a large green sapphire. When worn, the ring continually allows a living wearer to heal 1 point of damage per round and an equal amount of nonlethal damage. In addition, he is immune to bleed damage while wearing a ring of regeneration. If the wearer loses a limb, an organ, or any other body part while wearing this ring, the ring regenerates it as the spell. In either case, only damage taken while wearing the ring is regenerated.	Forge Ring, regenerate; Cost 45,000 gp
Ring of Shooting Stars	strong evocation	12th	50,000 gp	This ring has two modes of operation: one for being in dim light or outdoors at night, and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night.  During the night, under the open sky or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command.  Dancing lights (once per hour) Light (twice per night) Ball lightning (special, once per night) Shooting stars (special, three per week) The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the ring wearer controls them similarly (see the dancing lights spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created.  Number of Balls        Damage per Ball 1 lightning ball        4d6 points of electricity damage 2 lightning balls        3d6 points of electricity damage each 3 lightning balls        2d6 points of electricity damage each 4 lightning balls        1d6 points of electricity damage each Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. Multiple balls can be released in the same round.  The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. They impact for 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball) in a 5-foot-radius sphere for 24 points of fire damage.  Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it makes a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. Range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a save or be hit by the projectile.  Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties.  Faerie fire (twice per day) Spark shower (special, once per day) The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying a metal weapon. Those wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon take 4d8 points of damage.	Forge Ring, faerie fire, fireball, light, lightning bolt; Cost 25,000 gp
Ring of Spell Storing, Minor	faint evocation	5th	18,000 gp	A minor ring of spell storing contains up to three levels of spells (either divine or arcane, or even a mix of both spell types) that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. The user need not provide any material components or focus to cast the spell, and there is no arcane spell failure chance for wearing armor (because the ring wearer need not gesture). The activation time for the ring is the same as the casting time for the relevant spell, with a minimum of 1 standard action. For a randomly generated ring, treat it as a scroll to determine what spells are stored in it. If you roll a spell that would put the ring over the three-level limit, ignore that roll; the ring has no more spells in it. A spellcaster can cast any spells into the ring, so long as the total spell levels do not add up to more than three. Metamagic versions of spells take up storage space equal to their spell level modified by the metamagic feat. A spellcaster can use a scroll to put a spell into the minor ring of spell storing. The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells currently stored within it.	Forge Ring, imbue with spell ability; Cost 9,000 gp
Ring of Spell Storing	moderate evocation	9th	50,000 gp	As the minor ring of spell storing, except it holds up to 5 levels of spells.	Forge Ring, imbue with spell ability; Cost 25,000 gp
Ring of Spell Storing, Major	strong evocation	17th	200,000 gp	As the minor ring of spell storing, except it holds up to 10 levels of spells.	Forge Ring, imbue with spell ability; Cost 100,000 gp
Ring of Spell Turning	strong abjuration	13th	100,000 gp	Up to three times per day on command, this simple platinum band automatically reflects the next nine levels of spells cast at the wearer, exactly as if spell turning had been cast upon him.	Forge Ring, spell turning; Cost 50,000 gp
Ring of Sustenance	faint conjuration	5th	2,500 gp	This ring continually provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment. The ring also refreshes the body and mind, so that its wearer needs only sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. This allows a spellcaster that requires rest to prepare spells to do so after only 2 hours, but this does not allow a spellcaster to prepare spells more than once per day. The ring must be worn for a full week before it begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another week to reattune it to himself.	Forge Ring, create food and water; Cost 1,250 gp
Ring of Swimming	faint transmutation	2nd	2,500 gp	This silver ring usually has fish-like designs and motifs etched into the band. It continually grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Swim checks.	Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in the Swim skill; Cost 1,250 gp
Ring of Swimming, Inproved	moderate transmutation	7th	10,000 gp	As a ring of swimming, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer's Swim checks.	Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks in the Swim skill; Cost 5,000 gp
Ring of Telekinesis	moderate transmutation	9th	75,000 gp	This ring allows the caster to use the spell telekinesis on command.	Forge Ring, telekinesis; Cost 37,500 gp
Ring of Three Wishes	strong universal or evocation (if miracle is used)	20th	120,000 gp	This ring is set with three rubies. Each ruby stores a wish spell, activated by the ring. When a wish is used, that ruby disappears. For a randomly generated ring, roll 1d3 to determine the remaining number of rubies. When all the wishes are used, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.	Forge Ring, wish or miracle; Cost 97,500 gp
Ring of Water Walking	moderate transmutation	9th	15,000 gp	This ring is often made of coral or bluish metal decorated with wave motifs. It allows the wearer to continually utilize the effects of the spell water walk.	Forge Ring, water walk; Cost 7,500 gp
Ring of Wizardry	moderate (wizardry I) or strong (wizardry II–IV) (no school)	11th (I), 14th (II), 17th (III), 20th (IV)	20,000 gp (I), 40,000 gp (II), 70,000 gp (III), 100,000 gp (IV)	This special ring comes in four kinds (ring of wizardry I, ring of wizardry II, ring of wizardry III, and ring of wizardry IV), all of them useful only to arcane spellcasters. The wearer's arcane spells per day are doubled for one specific spell level. A ring of wizardry I doubles 1st-level spells, a ring of wizardry IIdoubles 2nd-level spells, a ring of wizardry III doubles 3rd-level spells, and a ring of wizardry IV doubles 4th-level spells. Bonus spells from high ability scores or school specialization are not doubled.	Forge Ring, limited wish; Cost 10,000 gp (I), 20,000 gp (II), 35,000 gp (III), 50,000 gp (IV)
Ring X-Ray Vision	moderate divination	6th	25,000 gp	On command, this ring gives its wearer the ability to see into and through solid matter. Vision range is 20 feet, with the viewer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if there is no illumination. X-ray vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead blocks the vision. Using the ring is exhausting, causing the wearer 1 point of Constitution damage per minute after the first 10 minutes of use in a single day. The ring must be used in 1-minute increments.	Forge Ring, true seeing; Cost 12,500 gp
Dungeon Ring	moderate divination	8th	16,000 gp (jailer's ring), 250 gp (prisoner's ring)	A jailer's dungeon ring is worked gold, set with a carnelian. The ring is magically attuned to one or more iron prisoner's dungeon rings. When the wearer of ajailer's ring places a prisoner's ring on a subject, the prisoner cannot remove the ring without the use of a remove curse, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. The wearer of the jailer's ring can also remove a linked prisoner's ring at any time. The jailer is aware of any wearer of a linked prisoner's ring like a constant status spell. Additionally, all wearers of linked prisoner's rings count as familiar to the jailer for purposes of spells such as scrying and teleport.	Forge Ring, scrying, status; Cost 8,000 gp (jailer's ring), 125 gp (prisoner's ring)
Ring of Arcane Signets	faint universal	1st	1,000 gp	The amorphous, approximately 1-inch-square chunk of rosy crystal that dominates this otherwise plain copper ring forms itself into a specific rune, sigil, or similar identifying marker each time a person first puts it on. If the wearer expects this to occur, he can cause the crystal to adopt any shape he wishes. If the wearer does not expect this to occur, the crystal instead molds itself into an image that symbolizes the wearer or some dominant facet of his personality. Once the crystal assumes this initial form, it always does so whenever the wearer puts on the ring. The wearer can, as a standard action, embed this image on any object (as if using arcane mark) simply by pressing the ring against it. The wearer may choose the color and other cosmetic features of the image each time he uses the ring. The brand is otherwise permanent unless removed by dispel magic, erase, or a more powerful spell.	Requirements Forge Ring, arcane mark; Cost 500 gp
Ring of Delayed Doom	moderate conjuration	9th	45,000 gp	This band has nine garnets embedded along its exterior. Whenever the wearer's mind or body first becomes subject to any harmful effect that allows a saving throw to resist or mitigate it, he may, as an immediate action, choose to delay the onset of that effect for 1 minute, after he fails the saving throw but before its effects occur. This activation causes one of the garnets to turn to powder. When that minute passes, the wearer may continue to delay the onset of this harmful effect an additional minute as an immediate action by willing the ring to do so, which destroys another garnet, thus repeating the cycle for another minute. The delayed harmful effect occurs when the wearer falls unconscious, when the ring is removed, or 1 minute after the last time the ring's power activated; rounds spent delaying the effect do not count toward the effect's duration (for example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the wearer delayed its effect several minutes). Effects that protect against or negate the harmful effect work normally while it is delayed, for example, neutralize poison cast on the wearer while he delays the effect of a poisonous bite removes the poison effect.	Forge Ring, heal, time stop; Cost 22,500 gp
Ring of ForceFangs	moderate evocation	9th	8,000 gp	This band negates any force spell or spell-like ability targeted at the wearer. Doing so gives the ring a number of charges equal to the spell level of the incoming force effect. The ring can hold a maximum of nine charges. If an incoming force attack would charge the ring beyond this limit, the ring does not negate the attack or gain charges, and the attack affects the wearer normally. On command, the wearer can use the ring's charges to cast magic missile, unleashing one missile (1d4+1 force damage) per charge but no more than five missiles per round.	Forge Ring, Heighten Spell, magic missile; Cost 4,000 gp
Ring of Maniacal Devices	faint transmutation	3rd	5,000 gp	This deceptively precious looking ring grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on all Craft (traps) and Disable Device checks. Even if he has no ranks in these skills, the wearer may make Craft (traps) and Disable Device checks as if he were trained in them.	Forge Ring, fox's cunning, creator must have 5 ranks in the relevant skill; Cost 2,500 gp
Ring of Retribution	strong evocation	13th	15,000 gp	Once per day, the wearer of this charred bone ring may, as an immediate action, cause it to detonate in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half). If the wearer is killed by the detonation, all magical equipment he carries must also save or take fire damage, and all nonmagical equipment takes this damage with no saving throw. This explosion never destroys the ring.	Forge Ring, Quicken Spell, fireball; Cost 7,500 gp
Ring of Revelation	faint or moderate varied	5th (lesser), 7th (greater), or 11th (superior)	10,000 gp (lesser), 16,000 gp (greater), 24,000 gp (superior)	A ring of revelation is a divine item attuned to a particular oracular mystery and containing a revelation associated with that mystery (see the oracle class description). While wearing the ring, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the ring, and must meet the level requirements (if any) of the revelation itself; for example, a ring of revelation (combat healer) is only usable by an oracle of at least 7th level with the battle mystery. If the oracle already has that revelation and the revelation gives an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day. The ring has no effect if worn by a non-oracle. A lesser ring of revelation contains a revelation that has no level prerequisite or a prerequisite that is less than 6th level. A greater ring of revelation contains a revelation that requires the oracle to be 7th level or higher. A superior ring of revelation contains a revelation that requires the oracle to be 11th level or higher.	Forge Ring, creator must be an oracle with the desired revelation; Cost 5,000 gp (lesser), 8,000 gp (greater), 12,000 gp (superior)
