Base Item	Armor Name	Slot	Aura Strength	Caster Level	Price	Weight	Description	Construction
studded leather	Armor of Insults	Armor	Moderate enchantment	7th	16,175 gp	20 lbs	Each metal bit of this suit of +1 studded leather looks more like a tiny sneering face than a simple stud. Once per day the wearer of the armor may command the mouths to unleash a torrent of verbal abuse directed against every hostile creature within 60 feet who can see and hear the wearer. Each such creature must make a DC 16 Will saving throw to avoid suffering an overwhelming compulsion to attack the wearer for the next 7 rounds. If the creature is unable to attack the wearer on its next turn, or attacking the wearer would put the creature at risk (moving through a threatened square, charging into a pit, and so on) it can act normally that turn. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect, and has no effect on creatures that do not use a spoken language.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, confusion; Cost 7,675 gp
leather	Boneless Armor	Armor	Faint transmutation	3rd	12,160 gp	15 lbs	This suit of +1 leather gives its wearer the ability to twist and contort his body in virtually any direction.

half-plate	Daystar Half-Plate	Armor	Strong evocation	15th	81,250 gp	50 lbs	The silvery sheen of this +1 half-plate causes it to sparkle in even the faintest light.

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, daylight, sunburst; Cost 41,000 gp
full plate	Folding Plate	Neck(broach) or Armor(unfolded)	Moderate conjuration (summoning)	10th	12,650 gp	— (brooch), 50 lbs. (armor)	This item normally looks like a heavy steel brooch or cloak clasp, often depicting a heavy helm or sturdy shield. On command, the brooch transforms in a clatter of metallic plates and panels to instantly cover the wearer in a complete suit of +1 full plate, with the design of the brooch displayed on the armor's breastplate. The same command word causes the armor to transform into the brooch. The brooch only transforms if the wearer's armor slot is unoccupied, thus it won't work if the wearer is already armored.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, instant summons; Cost 7,650 gp
banded mail	Forsaken Banded Mail	Armor	Moderate evocation	11th	25,400 gp	35 lbs	Every inch of this suit of +1 banded mail bears a defaced holy symbol or a design equally offensive to one or more gods and their servants. The wearer of the armor cannot cast divine spells or use any spell-like supernatural ability gained from a connection to a deity. The wearer gains SR 19 against any divine-origin spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability (such as a domain granted power or ability from an outsider serving a deity), and treats the armor's enhancement bonus as +2 higher against creatures with these abilities.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator cannot be a divine spellcaster; Cost 12,900 gp
Hide	Giant-Hide Armor	Armor	Strong transmutation	15th	39,165 gp (ogre), 46,665 gp (hill giant), 59,165 gp (troll), 54,165 gp (stone, fire, or frost giant), 69,165 gp (cloud giant), 76,665 gp (storm giant)	25 lbs	This drooping, many-folded suit of +3 hide armor is made from the tanned skin of an actual giant. Once per day on command, the wearer can grow to match the size of the appropriate giant, as if using giant form I (ogre, troll, hill giant, stone giant, fire giant, or frost giant) or giant form II (cloud giant or storm giant). This transformation lasts up to 15 minutes, and ends when the wearer commands. Most good folk consider wearing the skins of intelligent creatures to be abhorrent. Giants gain a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against the wearer, or +4 if the wearer's armor is made from the same kind of giant as the attacker.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, giant form I (ogre, troll, hill giant, stone giant, fire giant, or frost giant) or giant form II (cloud giant or storm giant); Cost 19,660 gp (ogre), 23,415 gp (hill giant), 29,665 gp (troll), 27,165 gp (stone, fire, or frost giant), 34,665 gp (cloud giant), 38,415 gp (storm giant)
chain shirt	Mist Armor	Armor	Faint conjuration	3rd	2,250 gp	25 lbs	The fine links of this +1 chain shirt form a pattern of roiling clouds. On command once per day, the wearer can transform it into thick fog that fills his space and provides concealment (20% miss chance). This mist moves with the character. Effects that disperse the mist or destroy it cause the armor to reform into its solid shape on the character's body, as does speaking the command word or entering a place where the fog-magic doesn't function (such as underwater). If the character tries to don another suit of armor while the mistmail is in fog form, it reforms at the character's feet.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, obscuring mist; Cost 1,250 gp
Padded	Murderer's Blackcloth	Armor	Moderate necromancy	9th	12,405 gp	10 lbs	This silk +1 shadow padded armor is as dark as night and stitched with thread the color of dried blood. When worn by a rogue with the bleed talent, it increases the bleed damage of the rogue's sneak attacks by +1. This armor also blurs the wearer whenever she tries to hide, while also dampening the sound around her, granting a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. The armor's armor check penalty still applies normally.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bleed, invisibility, silence; Cost 6,280 gp
Chainmail	Soothsayer's Raiment	Armor	Faint divination	5th	10,300 gp	40 lbs	This +1 chainmail is attuned to a particular oracular mystery and contains a revelation associated with that mystery (see the oracle class description). While wearing the armor, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the armor; for example, a soothsayer's raiment (battlecry) is only usable by an oracle of battle. If the wearer already has that revelation and the revelation gives an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect if worn by a non-oracle. For divination spells with a percentage-based chance of success (such as augury and divination), the wearer's chance increases by +5.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, augury, creator must be an oracle with the desired revelation; Cost 5,300 gp
Shield, tower	Battlement Shield	Shield	Moderate conjuration	9th	16,180 gp	45 lbs	Once per day on command, this +2 tower shield can transform into a solid, 10-foot by 10-foot by 1-foot wall of masonry with a battlement on top and an arrow slit in each 5-foot length. The wall acts as cover just like any physical wall. The wielder can touch the wall with one hand and command it to revert to a tower shield either resting on the ground and balanced against his hand or strapped to his arm in the normal fashion. The wall has all the characteristics of any other foot-thick wall of masonry (hardness 8, 90 hit points, break DC of 35). Attacks sufficient to destroy the wall cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. The shield remains in wall form until destroyed or commanded to return to shield form. The wall cannot appear in a space too small to accommodate it.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, wall of stone; Cost 8,180 gp
Shield, tower	Fortress Shield	Shield	Moderate conjuration	11th	19,180 gp	45 lbs	The wearer of this +1 tower shield may, as a full-round action, transform the shield into a 1-inch thick cube of iron that springs into being around him, completely enclosing his space. The cube has hardness 10 and 30 hit points per side. This cube grants the wearer total cover against everything outside the cube, including (as it is perfectly sealed) swarms and gas attacks. The inside of the cube is dark, and air cannot get in or out so the wearer must hold his breath starting on the third round after activating the cube. Attacks sufficient to destroy one side of the cube cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. Otherwise, the cube reverts to shield form upon command, if the wearer moves from his current space, or the wearer falls unconscious or dies.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, wall of iron; Cost 9,680 gp

Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal, gaining a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against fear. Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the armor, it does not function if the wearer hides or conceals herself in any way.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, mass charm monster; Cost 12,875 gp
chainmail	Celestral Armor	Armor	faint transmutation [good]	5th	22,400 gp	20 lbs	This bright silver or gold +3 chainmail is so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without betraying its presence.

full plate	Demon Armor	Armor	strong necromancy [evil]	13th	52,260 gp	50 lbs	This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon. The helmet is shaped to look like a horned demon head, and its wearer looks out of the open, tooth-filled mouth. This +4 full plate allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a contagion spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The “claws” are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets, and cannot be disarmed. A suit of demon armor is infused with evil, and as a result it bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. The negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the armor is worn.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, contagion; Cost 26,955 gp
