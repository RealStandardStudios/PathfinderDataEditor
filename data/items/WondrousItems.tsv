This ability affects all allied creatures within 1 mile as long as they are able to see the banner at least once a day.  Terror: Enemies of the bearer of a lord's banner of terror, while within 30 feet and able to see the banner, must make a Will saving throw (DC 16) or become panicked, fleeing as quickly as possible for as long as they can see the banner.

Other effects that detect or reveal invisible things work normally on the sheathed weapon	Craft Wondrous Item, invisibility; Cost 2,500 gp

Soul Soap	faint abjuration	1st	none	200 gp	2 lbs	This small bar of coarse gray soap has tiny pieces of ash, coal, or hard earth embedded in it, making the use of the soap uncomfortable and leaving anyone washed with it as dirty as before.

Vest of the Cockroach	faint necromancy	3rd	chest	16,000 gp	2 lbs	This padded and slightly bulky vest, made from dyed, red-brown cloth, causes its wearer to feel vaguely uncomfortable whenever lying prone.

Once applied, the wearer can, as a swift action, make the paint rearrange itself into a ghastly mélange of colors, making his appearance momentarily disturbing and hideous. The wearer chooses one creature who can see his painted face within 30 feet to be affected by cause fear (DC 11). Once the paint is used in this fashion, it loses all magic and becomes normal face paint. Once applied, the wearer has 24 hours to use the paint's magic; otherwise it fades away	raft Wondrous Item, cause fear; Cost 50 gp
Amulet of Mighty Fists	faint evocation	5th	neck	4,000 gp (+1), 16,000 gp (+2), 36,000 gp (+3), 64,000 (+4), 100,000 gp (+5)	-	This amulet grants an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on attack and damage rolls with unarmed attacks and natural weapons.  Alternatively, this amulet can grant melee weapon special abilities, so long as they can be applied to unarmed attacks. See Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities for a list of abilities.

The amulet allows its wearer to utilize plane shift. However, this is a difficult item to master. The user must make a DC 15Intelligence check in order to get the amulet to take her to the plane (and the specific location on that plane) that she wants.

Craft Wondrous Item, nondetection; Cost 17,500 gp
Apparatus of the Crab	strong evocation and transmutation	19th	none	90,000 gp	500 lbs	At first glance, an inactive apparatus of the crab appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel big enough to hold two Medium creatures. Close examination, and a DC 20 Perception check, reveals a secret catch that opens a hatch at one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds 10 (unlabeled) levers and seating for two Medium or Small occupants. These levers allow those inside to activate and control the apparatus's movements and actions.  Lever (1d10)        Lever Function 1        Extend/retract legs and tail 2        Uncover/cover forward porthole 3        Uncover/cover side portholes 4        Extend/retract pincers and feelers 5        Snap pincers 6        Move forward/backward 7        Turn left/right 8        Open/close “eyes” with continual flame inside 9        Rise/sink in water 10        Open/close hatch Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However, since two characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round. The device can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a giant lobster.  When active, an apparatus of the crab has the following characteristics: hp 200; hardness 15; Spd 20 ft., swim 20 ft.; AC 20 (–1 size, +11 natural); Attack 2 pincers +12 melee (2d8); CMB +14; CMD 24.

Bag of Holding	moderate conjuration	9th	none	-	-	This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag's contents, depend on the bag's type, as shown on the table below.  Bag          Bag Weight        Contents Limit        Contents Volume Limit        Market Price Type I       15 lbs.                250 lbs.                 30 cubic ft.                         2,500 gp Type II       25 lbs.               500 lbs.                 70 cubic ft.                         5,000 gp Type III      35 lbs.               1,000 lbs.              150 cubic ft.                        7,400 gp Type IV     60 lbs.               1,500 lbs.               250 cubic ft.                       10,000 gp If a bag of holding is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag.  If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: the hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.	Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest; Cost 1,250 gp (type I), 2,500 gp (type II), 3,700 gp (type III), 5,000 gp (type IV)

Anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill. Each of the three kinds of bags of tricks produces a different set of animals. Use the following tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.  Gray Bag        Rust Bag        Tan Bag d%        Animal        d%        Animal        d%        Animal 01–30        Bat        01–30        Wolverine        01–30        Grizzly bear 31–60        Rat        31–60        Wolf        31–60        Lion 61–75        Cat        61–85        Boar        61–80        Heavy horse 76–90        Weasel        86–100        Leopard        81–90        Tiger 91–100        Riding dog        —        91–100        Rhinoceros The heavy horse appears with harness and tack and accepts the character who drew it from the bag as a rider.

Bead of Force	moderate evocation	10th	-	3,000 gp	-	This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. A bead of force can be thrown up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.  Once thrown, a bead of force functions like a resilient sphere spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, disintegrate, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within. The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item.	Craft Wondrous Item, resilient sphere; Cost 1,500 gp

Boat, Folding	moderate transmutation	6th	-	7,200 gp	4 lbs	A folding boat looks like a small wooden box about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The folding boat cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship.

In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail.

Bottle of Air	moderate transmutation	7th	-	7,250 gp	2 lbs	This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork.

A cleric whose alignment matches the candle's operates as if two levels higher for purposes of determining spells per day if he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him as if he were of that higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn't interfere with its magical properties.  In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a gate spell, the respondent being of the same alignment as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in the process	Craft Wondrous Item, gate, creator must be same alignment as candle created; Cost 4,200 gp

Beautifully and intricately made, each carpet has its own command word to activate it—if the device is within voice range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions.

A carpet of flying can hover without making a Fly skill check and gives a +5 bonus to other Fly checks.	Craft Wondrous Item, overland flight; Cost 10,000 gp (5 ft. by 5 ft.), 17,500 gp (5 ft. by 10 ft.), 30,000 gp (10 ft. by 10 ft.)
Chime of Interruption	moderate evocation	7th	-	16,800 gp	1 lb	This instrument can be struck once every 10 minutes, and its resonant tone lasts for 3 full minutes.  While the chime is resonating, no spell requiring a verbal component can be cast within a 30-foot radius of it unless the caster can make a concentration check (DC 15 + the spell's level).	Craft Wondrous Item, shout; Cost 8,400 gp
Chime of Opening	moderate transmutation	11th	-	3,000 gp	1 lb	A chime of opening is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even an arcane lock cast by a wizard of lower than 15th level.  The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime's caster level of 11th. The DC of this check is equal to the Disable Device DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four successful uses of a chime of opening to get it open. A silence spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless.	Craft Wondrous Item, knock; Cost 1,500 gp
Circlet of Persuasion	faint transmutation	5th	head	4,500 gp	-	This silver headband grants a +3 competence bonus on the wearer's Charisma-based checks.	Craft Wondrous Item, eagle's splendor; Cost 2,250 gp
Cloak of Arachnida	moderate conjuration and transmutation	6th	shoulders	14,000 gp	1 lb	This black garment, embroidered with a web-like pattern in silk, gives the wearer the ability to climb as if a spider climb spell had been placed upon her. In addition, the cloak grants her immunity to entrapment by web spells or webs of any sort; she can actually move in webs at half her normal speed. Once per day, the wearer of this cloak can cast web. She also gains a +2 luck bonus on all Fortitude saves against poison from spiders.	Craft Wondrous Item, spider climb, web; Cost 7,000 gp
Cloak of the Bat	moderate transmutation	7th	shoulders	26,000 gp	1 lb	Fashioned of dark brown or black cloth, this cloak bestows a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. The wearer is also able to hang upside down from the ceiling like a bat.  By holding the edges of the garment, the wearer is able to fly as per the spell (including a +7 bonus on Fly skill checks). If he desires, the wearer can actually polymorph himself into an ordinary bat and fly accordingly (as beast shape III). All possessions worn or carried are part of the transformation. Flying, either with the cloak or in bat form, can be accomplished only in darkness (either under the night sky or in a lightless or near-lightless environment underground). Either of the flying powers is usable for up to 7 minutes at a time, but after a flight of any duration the cloak cannot bestow any flying power for a like period of time	Craft Wondrous Item, beast shape III, fly; Cost 13,000 gp
Cloak of Displacement, Major	moderate illusion	7th	shoulders	50,000 gp	1 lb	This item appears to be a normal cloak, but on command its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works just like the displacement spell and lasts for a total of 15 rounds per day, which the wearer can divide up as she sees fit	Craft Wondrous Item, Extend Spell, displacement; Cost 25,000 gp
Cloak of Displacement, Minor	faint illusion	3rd	shoulders	24,000 gp	1 lb	This item appears to be a normal cloak, but when worn by a character, its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works similar to the blur spell, granting a 20% miss chance on attacks against the wearer. It functions continually	Craft Wondrous Item, blur; Cost 12,000 gp
Cloak of Elvenkind	faint illusion	3rd	shoulders	2,500 gp	1 lb	When this plain gray cloak is worn with the hood drawn up around the head, the wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks.	Craft Wondrous Item, invisibility, creator must be an elf; Cost 1,250 gp
Cloak of Etherealness	strong transmutation	15th	shoulders	55,000 gp	1 lb	This silvery gray cloak seems to absorb light rather than be illuminated by it. On command, the cloak makes its wearer ethereal (as the ethereal jaunt spell). The effect is dismissible. The cloak works for a total of up to 10 minutes per day. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1 minute increments	Craft Wondrous Item, ethereal jaunt; Cost 27,500 gp
Cloak of the Manta Ray	moderate transmutation	9th	shoulders	7,200 gp	1 lb	This cloak appears to be made of leather until the wearer enters salt water. At that time, the cloak of the manta ray adheres to the individual, and he appears nearly identical to a manta ray (as the beast shape II spell, except that it allows only manta ray form). He gains a +3 natural armor bonus, the ability to breathe underwater, and a swim speed of 60 feet, like a real manta ray.  The cloak does allow the wearer to attack with a manta ray's tail spine, dealing 1d6 points of damage. This attack can be used in addition to any other attack the character has, using his highest melee attack bonus. The wearer can release his arms from the cloak without sacrificing underwater movement if so desired	Craft Wondrous Item, beast shape II, water breathing; Cost 3,600 gp
Cloak of Resistance	faint abjuration	5th	shoulders	1,000 gp (+1), 4,000 gp (+2), 9,000 gp (+3), 16,000 gp (+4), 25,000 gp (+5)	1 lb	These garments offer magic protection in the form of a +1 to +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws (Fortitude, Reflex, and Will)	Craft Wondrous Item, resistance, creator's caster level must be at least three times the cloak's bonus; Cost 500 gp (+1), 2,000 gp (+2), 4,500 gp (+3), 8,000 gp (+4), 12,500 gp (+5)
Crown of Blasting, Minor	moderate evocation	6th	head	6,480 gp	1 lb	On command, this simple golden crown projects a blast of searing light (3d8 points of damage) once per day	Craft Wondrous Item, searing light; Cost 3,240 gp

Cystal ball	moderate divination	10th	-	-	7 lbs	This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. So well-known are these items that many so-called oracles or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely non-magical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. A character can use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell scrying (Will DC 16 negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use.  Certain crystal balls have additional powers that can be used through the crystal ball on the target viewed.  Crystal Ball Type        Market Price Crystal ball        42,000 gp Crystal ball with see invisibility        50,000 gp Crystal ball with telepathy*        70,000 gp Crystal ball with true seeing        80,000 gp Crystal ball with detect thoughts (Will DC 13 negates)        51,000 gp * The viewer is able to send and receive silent mental messages with the person appearing in the crystal ball. Once per day, the character may attempt to implant a suggestion (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) as well. 	Craft Wondrous Item, scrying (plus any additional spells put into item); Cost 21,000 gp (standard), 25,000 (with see invisibility), 25,500 gp (with detect thoughts), 35,000 gp (with telepathy), 40,000 gp (with true seeing)
Cube of Force	moderate evocation	10th	-	62,000 gp	1/2 lb	This device is just under an inch across and can be made of ivory, bone, or any hard mineral. Typically, each of the cube's faces are polished smooth, but sometimes they are etched with runes. The device enables its possessor to put up a special cube made up of 6 individual wall of force spells, 10 feet on a side around her person. This cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges when fully charged—charges used are automatically renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active, the possessor's speed is limited to the maximum value given on the table.  When the cube of force is active, attacks dealing more than 30 points of damage drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30 that they deal. The charge cost to maintain each of the cube's six walls is summarized below.  Cube Face        Charge Cost per Minute        Max. Speed        Effect 1        1        30 ft.

Cube of Frost Resistance	faint abjuration	5th	-	27,000 gp	2 lbs	This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cube-shaped area 10 feet on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a surface). The temperature within this area is always at least 65° F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 round (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses and cannot be reactivated for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage in a 10-round period, the cube is destroyed.	Craft Wondrous Item, protection from energy; Cost 13,500 gp
Cubic Gate	strong conjuration	13th	-	164,000 gp	2 lbs	This potent magical item is a small cube fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a different plane of existence or dimension, one of which is the Material Plane. The character creating the item chooses the planes to which the other five sides are keyed.  If a side of the cubic gate is pressed once, it opens a gate to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the gate. It is impossible to open more than one gate at a time.  If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves.	Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift; Cost 82,000 gp
Darkskull	moderate evocation [evil]	9th	-	60,000 gp	5 lbs	This skull, carved from ebony, is wholly evil. Wherever the skull goes, the area around it is treated as though an unhallow spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin. Each darkskull has a single spell effect tied to it. This spell is from the standard list given in the unhallow spell description, and it cannot be changed.	Craft Wondrous Item, unhallow, creator must be evil; Cost 30,000 gp
Decanter of Endless Water	moderate transmutation	9th	-	9,000 gp	2 lbs	If the stopper is removed from this ordinary-looking flask and a command word spoken, an amount of fresh or salt water pours out. Separate command words determine the type of water as well as the volume and velocity.  “Stream” pours out 1 gallon per round. “Fountain” produces a 5-foot-long stream at 5 gallons per round. “Geyser” produces a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30 gallons per round. The geyser effect exerts considerable pressure, requiring the holder to make a DC 12 Strength check to avoid being knocked down each round the effect is maintained. In addition, the powerful force of the geyser deals 1d4 points of damage per round to a creature that is subjected to it. The geyser can only affect one target per round, but the user can direct the beam of water without needing to make an attack role to strike the target since the geyser's constant flow allows for ample opportunity to aim. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d4 points of damage per round from the geyser rather than 1d4. The command word must be spoken to stop it.	Craft Wondrous Item, control water; Cost 4,500 gp
Deck of Illusions	moderate illusion	6th	-	8,100 gp	1/2 lb	This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wooden box. A full deck consists of 34 cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a major image of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents of a full deck using either ordinary playing cards or tarot cards.)  Playing Card        Tarot Card        Creature Ace of hearts        IV.

If cards are missing, reduce the price by a corresponding amount.  	Craft Wondrous Item, major image; Cost 4,050 gp
Dimensional Shackles	moderate abjuration	11th	wrists	28,000 gp	5 lbs	These shackles have golden runes traced across their cold iron links. Any creature bound within them is affected as if a dimensional anchor spell were cast upon it (no save). They fit any Small to Large creature. The DC to break or slip out of the shackles is 30	Craft Wondrous Item, dimensional anchor; Cost 14,000 gp
Drums of Panic	moderate necromancy	7th	-	30,000 gp	10 lbs. for the pair	These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a 20-foot-radius safe zone around the drums) are affected as by afear spell (Will DC 16 partial). Drums of panic can be used once per day	Craft Wondrous Item, fear; Cost 15,000 gp
Dust of Appearance	faint conjuration	5th	-	1,800 gp	-	This powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of blur and displacement. In this, it works just like the faerie fire spell. The dust also reveals figments, mirror images, and projected images for what they are. A creature coated with the dust takes a –30 penalty on its Stealth checks. The dust's effect lasts for 5 minutes.  Dust of appearance is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes.	Craft Wondrous Item, glitterdust; Cost 900 gp
Dust of Disappearance	moderate illusion	7th	-	3,500 gp	-	This dust looks like dust of appearance and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as greater invisibility). Normal vision can't see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including see invisibility or invisibility purge.Dust of appearance, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by dust of disappearance. Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection. The greater invisibility bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d6 rounds. The invisible creature doesn't know when the duration will end.	Craft Wondrous Item, greater invisibility; Cost 1,750 gp
Dust of Dryness	moderate transmutation	11th	-	850 gp	-	This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed into nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.  If the dust is employed against an outsider with the elemental and water subtypes, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the creature even if its saving throw succeeds.	Craft Wondrous Item, control water; Cost 425 gp
Dust of Illusion	moderate illusion	6th	-	1,200 gp	-	This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or powdered graphite. Stare at it, however, and the dust changes color and form. Put dust of illusion on a creature, and that creature is affected as if by a disguise self glamer, with the individual who sprinkles the dust envisioning the illusion desired. An unwilling target is allowed a DC 11 Reflex save to avoid the dust. The glamer lasts for 2 hours.	Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self; Cost 600 gp
Dust of Trancelessness	faint transmutation	3rd	-	250 gp	-	This normal-seeming dust is actually a magic powder that can conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions. Tossing a handful of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 100 square feet of floor space to become as dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a decade.  A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as many as a dozen men and horses to be obliterated for 250 feet back into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, and no magical aura lingers afterward from this use of the dust. Survival checks made to track a quarry across an area affected by this dust have a DC 20 higher than normal.	Craft Wondrous Item, pass without trace; Cost 125 gp
Efficient Quiver	moderate conjuration	9th	-	1,800 gp	2 lbs	This appears to be a typical arrow container capable of holding about 20 arrows. It has three distinct portions, each with a nondimensional space allowing it to store far more than would normally be possible. The first and smallest one can contain up to 60 objects of the same general size and shape as an arrow. The second slightly longer compartment holds up to 18 objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains as many as 6 objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (spears, staves, or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can quickly produce any item she wishes that is within the quiver, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard. The efficient quiver weighs the same no matter what's placed inside it	Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest; Cost 900 gp
Efreeti Bottle	strong conjuration	14th	-	145,000 gp	1 lb	This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. Periodically, a thin stream of bitter-smelling smoke issues from the bottle's top. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly amid a cloud of noxious smoke. There is a 10% chance (01–10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91–100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three wishes. In either case, afterward the efreeti disappears forever, and the bottle becomes nonmagical. The other 80% of the time (11–90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti's death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day's effect.	Craft Wondrous Item, planar binding; Cost 72,500 gp
Elemental Gem	moderate conjuration	11th	-	2,250 gp	-	An elemental gem comes in one of four different varieties. Each contains a conjuration spell attuned to a specific elemental plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water).  When the gem is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a Large elemental appears as if summoned by a summon nature's ally spell. The elemental is under the control of the creature that broke the gem.  The coloration of the gem varies with the type of elemental it summons. Air elemental gems are transparent, earth elemental gems are light brown, fire elemental gems are reddish orange, and water elemental gems are blue-green.	Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster V or summon nature's ally V; Cost 1,125 gp
Elixir of Fire Breath	moderate evocation	11th	-	1,100 gp	-	This strange bubbling elixir bestows upon the drinker the ability to spit gouts of flame. He can breathe fire up to three times, each time dealing 4d6 points of fire damage to a single target up to 25 feet away. The victim can attempt a DC 13 Reflex save for half damage. Unused blasts of fire dissipate 1 hour after the liquid is consumed.	Craft Wondrous Item, scorching ray; Cost 550 gp
Elixir of Hiding	faint illusion	5th	-	250 gp	-	A character drinking this liquid gains an intuitive ability to sneak and hide (+10 competence bonus on Stealth checks for 1 hour).	Craft Wondrous Item, invisibility; Cost 125 gp
Elixir of Love	faint enchantment	4th	-	150 gp	-	This sweet-tasting liquid causes the character drinking it to become enraptured with the first creature she sees after consuming the draft (as charm person—the drinker must be a humanoid of Medium or smaller size, Will DC 14 negates). The charm effect wears off in 1d3 hours	Craft Wondrous Item, charm person; Cost 75 gp
Elixir of Swimming	faint transmutation	2nd	-	250 gp	-	This elixir bestows swimming ability. An almost imperceptible magic sheath surrounds the drinker, allowing him to glide through the water easily (+10 competence bonus on Swim checks for 1 hour).	Craft Wondrous Item, creator must have 5 ranks in the Swim skill; Cost 125 gp
Elixir of Truth	faint enchantment	5th	-	500 gp	-	This elixir forces the drinker it to say nothing but the truth for 10 minutes (Will DC 13 negates). She must answer any questions put to her in that time, but with each question she can make a separate DC 13 Will save. If one of these secondary saves is successful, she doesn't break free of the truth-compelling enchantment but also doesn't have to answer that particular question (if she does answer, she must tell the truth). No more than one question can be asked each round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment	Craft Wondrous Item, zone of truth; Cost 250 gp
Elixir of Tumbling	faint transmutation	5th	-	250 gp	-	This draught of liquid grants the drinker the ability to tumble about, avoiding attacks and moving carefully across nearly any surface, granting a +10 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks for 1 hour	Craft Wondrous Item, cat's grace; Cost 125 gp
Elixir of Vision	faint divination	2nd	-	250 gp	-	Drinking this elixir grants the imbiber the ability to notice acute details with great accuracy (+10 competence bonus on Perception checks for 1 hour).	Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Cost 125 gp
Eversmoking Bottle	faint transmutation	3rd	-	5,400 gp	1 lb	This metal urn is identical in appearance to an efreeti bottle, except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains smoke-filled until the eversmoking bottle is stoppered.  The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke dissipates normally. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round	Craft Wondrous Item, pyrotechnics; Cost 2,700 gp
Eyes of Charming	moderate enchantment	7th	eyes	56,000 gp for a pair	-	These two crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes. The wearer is able to use charm person (one target per round) merely by meeting a target's gaze. Those failing a DC 16 Will save are charmed as per the spell. Both lenses must be worn for the magic item to take effect	Craft Wondrous Item, Heighten Spell, charm person; Cost 28,000 gp
Eyes of Doom	moderate necromancy	11th	eyes	25,000 gp	-	These crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes, enabling him to cast doom upon those around him (one target per round) as a gaze attack, except that the wearer must take a standard action, and those merely looking at the wearer are not affected. Those failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the doomspell. The wearer also gains the additional power of a continual deathwatch effect and can use fear (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack once per week. Both lenses must be worn for the magic item to take effect.	Craft Wondrous Item, doom, deathwatch, fear; Cost 12,500 gp
Eyes of the Eagle	faint divination	3rd	eyes	2,500 gp	-	These items are made of special crystal and fit over the eyes of the wearer. These lenses grant a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks.

Craft Wondrous Item, clairaudience/clairvoyance; Cost 1,250 gp
Feather Token	strong conjuration	12th	-	50 gp (anchor), 300 gp (bird), 200 gp (fan), 450 gp (swan boat), 400 gp (tree), 500 gp (whip)	-	Each of these items is a small feather that has a power to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are described below. Each token is usable once. A particular feather token has no specific features to identify it unless its magic aura is viewed—even tokens with identical powers can be wildly different in appearance.  Anchor: A token that creates an anchor that moors a craft in water so as to render it immobile for up to 1 day.  Bird: A token that creates a small bird that can be used to deliver a small written message unerringly to a designated target. The token lasts as long as it takes to carry the message.  Fan: A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed. The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land.  Swan Boat: A token that forms a swan-like boat capable of moving on water at a speed of 60 feet. It can carry eight horses and gear, 32 Medium characters, or any equivalent combination. The boat lasts for 1 day.  Tree: A token that causes a great oak to spring into being (5-foot-diameter trunk, 60-foot height, 40-foot top diameter). This is an instantaneous effect.  Whip: A token that forms into a huge leather whip and wields itself against any opponent desired just like a dancing weapon. The weapon has a +10 base attack bonus, does 1d6+1 points of nonlethal damage, has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and a makes a free grapple attack (with a +15 bonus on its combat maneuver checks) if it hits. The whip lasts no longer than 1 hour.	Craft Wondrous Item, major creation; Cost 25 gp (anchor), 150 gp (bird), 100 gp (fan), 225 gp (swan boat), 200 gp (tree), 250 gp (whip)
Figurines of Wonderous Power	varies	varies	-	10,000 gp (bronze griffon), 10,000 gp (ebony fly), 16,500 gp (golden lions), 21,000 gp (ivory goats), 17,000 gp (marble elephant), 28,500 gp (obsidian steed), 15,500 gp (onyx dog), 9,100 gp (serpentine owl), 3,800 gp (silver raven)	1 lb	Each of the several kinds of figurines of wondrous power appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.  If a figurine of wondrous power is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.  Bronze Griffon: When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects.  Ebony Fly: When animated, an ebony fly is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a pegasus but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects.  Golden Lions: These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for 1 full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects.  Ivory Goats: These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function:  The Goat of Traveling: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of 1 day each week—continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used. The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time. The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects. Marble Elephant: This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a marble elephant grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine's owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects.  Obsidian Steed: This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: overland flight, plane shift, and ethereal jaunt. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means. Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, etherealness, fly, plane shift.  Onyx Dog: When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. It has the scent ability and adds +4 on its Perception checks. It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can see invisibility. An onyx dog can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects.  Serpentine Owl: This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl (use the stats for the giant eagle) according to the command word used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects.  Silver Raven: This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an animal messenger spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous. Moderate enchantment and transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, animal messenger, animate objects.	Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, additional spells, see text; Cost 5,000 gp (bronze griffon), 5,000 gp (ebony fly), 8,250 gp (golden lions), 10,500 gp (ivory goats), 8,500 gp (marble elephant), 14,250 gp (obsidian steed), 7,750 gp (onyx dog), 4,550 gp (serpentine owl), 1,900 gp (silver raven)
Gauntlet of Rust	moderate transmutation	7th	hands	11,500 gp	2 lbs	This single metal gauntlet looks rusted and pitted but is actually quite powerful. Once per day, it can affect an object as with the rusting grasp spell. It also completely protects the wearer and her gear from rust (magical or otherwise), including the attack of a rust monster.	Craft Wondrous Item, rusting grasp; Cost 5,750 gp
Gem of Brightness	moderate evocation	6th	-	13,000 gp	-	This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of a command word, though, the gem's facets suddenly grow highly polished as the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.  One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges, and it continues to emit light until this command word is spoken a second time to extinguish the illumination. Another command word causes the gem of brightness to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge. The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges. A newly created gem of brightness has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical and its facets grow cloudy with a fine network of cracks.\	Craft Wondrous Item, daylight; Cost 6,500 gp
Gem of Seeing	moderate divination	10th	-	75,000 gp	-	This finely cut and polished stone is indistinguishable from an ordinary jewel in appearance. When it is gazed through, a gem of seeing enables the user to see as though she were affected by the true seeing spell. A gem of seeing can be used for as many as 30 minutes a day, in increments of 5 minutes. These increments do not need to be consecutive.	Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Cost 37,500 gp
Gloves of Arrow Snaring	faint abjuration	3rd	hands	4,000 gp	-	Once worn, these snug gloves seem to meld with the hands, becoming almost invisible to casual observation. Twice per day, the wearer can act as if he had the Snatch Arrows feat (see Feats for details), even if he does not meet the prerequisites for the feat. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective, and at least one hand must be free to take advantage of the magic	Craft Wondrous Item, shield; Cost 2,000 gp
Glove of Storing	moderate transmutation	6th	hands	10,000 gp (one glove)	-	This device is a single leather glove. On command, one item held in the hand wearing the glove disappears. The item can weigh no more than 20 pounds and must be able to be held in one hand. While stored, the item has negligible weight. With a snap of the fingers wearing the glove, the item reappears. A glove can only store one item at a time. Storing or retrieving the item is a free action. The item is shrunk down so small within the palm of the glove that it cannot be seen. Spell durations are not suppressed, but continue to expire. If the glove's effect is suppressed or dispelled, the stored item appears instantly. A glove of storing uses up your entire hands slot. You may not use another item (even another glove of storing) that also uses the hands slot.	Craft Wondrous Item, shrink item; Cost 5,000 gp
Gloves of Swimming and Climbing	faint transmutation	5th	hands	6,250 gp	-	These apparently normal lightweight gloves grant a +5 competence bonus on Swim checks and Climb checks. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective	Craft Wondrous Item, bull's strength, cat's grace; Cost 3,125 gp
Goggles of Minute Seeing	faint divination	3rd	eyes	2,500 gp	-	The lenses of this item are made of special crystal. When placed over the eyes of the wearer, the lenses enable her to see much better than normal at distances of 1 foot or less, granting her a +5 competence bonus on Disable Device checks. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.	Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Cost 1,250 gp
Goggles of Night	faint transmutation	3rd	eyes	12,000 gp	-	The lenses of this item are made of dark crystal. Even though the lenses are opaque, when placed over the eyes of the wearer, they enable him to see normally and also grant him 60-foot darkvision. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective	Craft Wondrous Item, darkvision; Cost 6,000 gp
Golem Manual	varies	varies	-	12,000 gp (clay), 8,000 gp (flesh), 35,000 gp (iron), 22,000 gp (stone), 44,000 gp (stone guardian)	5 lbs	A golem manual contains information, incantations, and magical power that help a character to craft a golem. The instructions therein grant a +5 competence bonus on skill checks made to craft the golem's body. Each manual also holds the prerequisite spells needed for a specific golem (although these spells can only be used to create a golem and cannot be copied), effectively granting the builder use of the Craft Construct feat during the construction of the golem, and an increase to her caster level for the purpose of crafting a golem.  The spells included in a golem manual require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem's body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book's ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated.  Clay Golem Manual: The book contains animate objects, bless, commune, prayer, and resurrection. The reader may treat her caster level as two levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a clay golem. Moderate conjuration, divination, enchantment, and transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Construct, creator must be caster level 11th, animate objects, commune, prayer, resurrection.

Hand of Glory	faint varied	5th	neck	8,000 gp	2 lbs	This mummified human hand hangs by a leather cord around a character's neck (taking up space as a magic necklace would). If a magic ring is placed on one of the fingers of the hand, the wearer benefits from the ring as if wearing it herself, and it does not count against her two-ring limit. The hand can wear only one ring at a time. Even without a ring, the hand itself allows its wearer to use daylight and see invisibility each once per day.	Craft Wondrous Item, animate dead, daylight, see invisibility; Cost 4,000 gp
Hand of the Mage	faint transmutation	2nd	neck	900 gp	2 lbs	This mummified elf hand hangs by a golden chain around a character's neck (taking up space as a magic necklace would). It allows the wearer to utilize the spell mage hand at will	Craft Wondrous Item, mage hand; Cost 450 gp
Handy Hoversack	moderate conjuration	9th	-	2,000 gp	5 lbs	A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.  While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.	Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest; Cost 1,000 gp
Harp of Charming	faint enchantment	5th	-	7,500 gp	5 lbs	This beautiful and intricately carved harp can be held comfortably in one hand, but both hands are required to utilize its magic.

If the check fails, the audience cannot be affected by any further performances from the harpist for 24 hours.	Craft Wondrous Item, suggestion; Cost 3,750 gp
Hat of  Disguise	faint illusion	1st	head	1,800 gp	-	This apparently normal hat allows its wearer to alter her appearance as with a disguise self spell.

Often, the headband contains additional designs to further accentuate the appearance of a third, crystal eye.  The headband grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to two mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. These bonuses are chosen when the headband is created and cannot be changed. If the headband grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence.

After being worn for 24 hours, the headband grants a number of skill ranks in those skills equal to the wearer's total Hit Dice. These ranks do not stack with the ranks a creature already possesses. These skills are chosen when the headband is created. If no skill is listed, the headband is assumed to grant skill ranks in randomly determined Knowledge skills.	Craft Wondrous Item, fox's cunning; Cost 2,000 gp (+2), 8,000 gp (+4), 18,000 gp (+6)
Helm of Brilliance	strong varied	13th	head	125,000 gp	3 lbs	This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: 10 diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and 40 opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows:  Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20) Ruby: Wall of fire Fire opal: Fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half) Opal: Daylight The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated.  It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range. The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect. The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources. Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.  If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.	Craft Wondrous Item, detect undead, fireball, flame blade, daylight, prismatic spray, protection from energy, wall of fire; Cost 62,500 gp
Helm of Comprehend Languages and Read Magic	faint divination	4th	head	5,200 gp	3 lbs	Appearing as a normal helmet, a helm of comprehend languages and read magic grants its wearer the ability to understand the spoken words of any creature and to read text in any language and any magical writing.

Note that understanding a magical text does not necessarily imply spell use	Craft Wondrous Item, comprehend languages, read magic; Cost 2,600 gp
Helm of Telepathy	faint divination and enchantment	5th	head	27,000 gp	3 lbs	This pale metal or ivory helm covers much of the head when worn. The wearer can use detect thoughts at will. Furthermore, he can send a telepathic message to anyone whose surface thoughts he is reading (allowing two-way communication). Once per day, the wearer of the helm can implant asuggestion (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) along with his telepathic message	Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, suggestion; Cost 13,500 gp
Helm of Teleportation	moderate conjuration	9th	head	73,500 gp	3 lbs	A character wearing this device may teleport three times per day, exactly as if he had cast the spell of the same name.	Craft Wondrous Item, teleport; Cost 36,750 gp
Helm of Underwater Action	faint transmutation	5th	head	24,000 gp	3 lbs	The wearer of this helmet can see underwater. Drawing the small lenses in compartments on either side into position before the wearer's eyes activates the visual properties of the helm, allowing her to see five times farther than water and light conditions would allow for normal human vision. (Weeds, obstructions, and the like block vision in the usual manner.) If the command word is spoken, the helm of underwater action gives the wearer a 30-foot swim speed and creates a globe of air around the wearer's head and maintains it until the command word is spoken again, enabling her to breathe freely.	Craft Wondrous Item, water breathing; Cost 12,000 gp
Horn of Blasting	moderate evocation	7th	-	20,000 gp	1 lb	This horn appears to be a normal trumpet. It can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the command word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it deals 5d6 points of sonic damage to creatures within a 40-foot cone and causes them to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (a DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the deafening). Crystalline objects and creatures take 7d6 points of sonic damage, with no save unless they're held, worn, or carried by creatures (Fortitude DC 16 negates).  If a horn of blasting is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a 20% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals 10d6 points of sonic damage to the person sounding it.	Craft Wondrous Item, shout; Cost 10,000 gp
Horn of Blasting, Greater	strong evocation	16th	-	70,000 gp	1 lb	This horn functions as a horn of blasting, except that it deals 10d6 points of sonic damage, stuns creatures for 1 round, and deafens them for 4d6 rounds (a DC 19 Fortitude reduces the damage by half and negates the stunning and deafening). Crystalline objects take 16d6 points of sonic damage as described for the horn of blasting. A greater horn of blasting also has a 20% cumulative chance of exploding for each usage beyond the first each day.	Craft Wondrous Item, greater shout; Cost 35,000 gp
Horn of Fog	faint conjuration	3rd	-	2,000 gp	1 lb	This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an obscuring mist spell. The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower each round that the user continues to blow the horn; a fog cloud travels 10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation point unless blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a deep, foghorn-like noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.	Craft Wondrous Item, obscuring mist; Cost 1,000 gp
Horn of Goodness/Evil	moderate abjuration	6th	-	6,500 gp	1 lb	This trumpet adapts itself to its owner, so it produces either a good or an evil effect depending on the owner's alignment. If the owner is neither good nor evil, the horn has no power whatsoever. If he is good, then blowing the horn has the effect of a magic circle against evil. If he is evil, then blowing the horn has the effect of a magic circle against good. In either case, this ward lasts for 1 hour. The horn can be blown once per day	Craft Wondrous Item, magic circle against good, magic circle against evil; Cost 3,250 gp
Horn of Valhalla	strong conjuration	13th	-	50,000 gp	2 lb	This magic instrument comes in four varieties. Each appears to be normal until someone speaks its command word and blows the horn. Then the horn summons a number of human barbarians to fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can be blown just once every 7 days. Roll d% and refer to the table above to see what type of horn is found. The horn's type determines what barbarians are summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a horn of Valhalla but doesn't have the prerequisite is attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned.  Horn of Valhalla d%        Type of Horn         Barbarians Summoned        Prerequisite 01–40        Silver        2d4+2, 2nd-level        None 41–75        Brass        2d4+1, 3rd-level        Spellcaster level 1st 76–90        Bronze        2d4, 4th-level        Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic performance ability 91–100        Iron        1d4+1, 5th-level        Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic performance ability Summoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people (though they seem to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for barbarians. They attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until they or their opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first.	Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI; Cost 25,000 gp
Horseshoes of Speed	faint transmutation	3rd	feet	3,000 gp	12 lbs. (for four)	These iron shoes come in sets of four like ordinary horseshoes. When affixed to an animal's hooves, they increase the animal's base land speed by 30 feet; this counts as an enhancement bonus. As with other effects that increase speed, jumping distances increase proportionally (see Using Skills). All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective.	Craft Wondrous Item, haste; Cost 1,500 gp
Horseshoes of a Zephyr	faint transmutation	3rd	feet	6,000 gp	4 lbs. (for four)	These four iron shoes are affixed like normal horseshoes. They allow a horse to travel without actually touching the ground. The horse must still run above (always around 4 inches above) a roughly horizontal surface. This means that non-solid or unstable surfaces can be crossed, and that movement is possible without leaving tracks on any sort of ground. The horse moves at its normal base land speed. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective.	Craft Wondrous Item, levitate; Cost 3,000 gp
Incense of Meditation	moderate enchantment	7th	-	4,900 gp	1 lb	This small rectangular block of sweet-smelling incense is visually indistinguishable from nonmagical incense until lit. When it is burned, the special fragrance and pearly hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 Spellcraft check.  When a divine spellcaster lights a block of incense of meditation and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense enables him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the Maximize Spell feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal level, not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat).  Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24 hours.	Craft Wondrous Item, Maximize Spell, bless; Cost 2,450 gp
Instant Fortress	strong conjuration	13th	-	55,000 gp	1 lb	This metal cube is small, but when activated by speaking a command word it grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress—even knock spells can't open the door.  The adamantine walls of an instant fortress have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a wish or a miracle, which restores 50 points of damage taken.  The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 half).  The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.	Craft Wondrous Item, mage's magnificent mansion; Cost 27,500 gp
Ioun Stones	strong varied	12th	-	Varies	-	These crystalline stones always float in the air and must be within 3 feet of their owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires a stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, a stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5. The powers of each stone vary depending on its color and shape (see the table).

Regeneration from the pearly white ioun stone works like a ring of regeneration. It only cures damage taken while the character is using the stone. The pale lavender and lavender-and-green stones work like a rod of absorption, but absorbing a spell requires a readied action, and these stones cannot be used to empower spells. Stored spells in the vibrant purple stone must be placed by a spellcaster but can be used by anyone (see ring of minor spell storing).	Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be 12th level; Cost half the market price
Iron Bands of Binding	strong evocation	13th	-	26,000 gp	1 lb	This potent item appears to be a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere with bandings on the globe.  When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile (as if pinned) until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and destroy) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. Iron bands of binding are usable once per day.	Craft Wondrous Item, grasping hand; Cost 13,000 gp
Iron Flask	strong conjuration	20th	-	170,000 gp (empty)	1 lb	These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature.  The command word can be used only once per day.  If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. A newly discovered bottle might contain any of the following:  d%        Contents 01–50        Empty 51–54        Large air elemental 55–58        Invisible stalker 59–62        Large earth elemental 63–66        Xorn 67–70        Large fire elemental 71–74        Salamander 95 75–78        Large water elemental 79–82        Xill 83–85        Yeth hound 86        Demon (shadow) 87        Demon (vrock) 88        Demon (hezrou) 89        Demon (glabrezu) 90        Demon (succubus) 91        Devil (osyluth) 92        Devil (barbazu) 93        Devil (erinyes) 94        Devil (cornugon) 95        Agathion (avoral) 96        Azata (ghaele) 97        Archon (trumpet) 98        Rakshasa 99        Demon (balor) 100        Devil (pit fiend) 	Craft Wondrous Item, trap the soul; Cost 85,000 gp
Lantern of Revealing	faint evocation	5th	-	30,000 gp	2 lbs	This lantern operates as a normal hooded lantern. While it is lit, it also reveals all invisible creatures and objects within 25 feet of it, just like the spellinvisibility purge.	Craft Wondrous Item, invisibility purge; Cost 15,000 gp
Lens of Detection	moderate divination	9th	eyes	3,500 gp	1 lb	This circular prism lets its user detect minute details, granting a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks. It also aids in tracking, adding a +5 competence bonus on Survival checks when tracking. The lens is about 6 inches in diameter and set in a frame with a handle.	Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Cost 1,750 gp
Lyre of Building	moderate transmutation	6th	-	13,000 gp	5 lbs	This magical instrument is usually made of gold and inlaid with numerous gems. If the proper chords are struck, a single use of this lyre negates any attacks made against inanimate construction (walls, roof, floor, and so on) within 300 feet. This includes the effects of a horn of blasting, a disintegrate spell, or an attack from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes.  The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week, its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, etc. The effect produced in 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring for 3 days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre must make a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check. If it fails, she must stop and cannot play the lyre again for this purpose until a week has passed.	Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate; Cost 6,500 gp
Mantle of Faith	strong abjuration [good]	20th	chest	76,000 gp	-	This holy garment, worn over normal clothing, grants damage reduction 5/evil to the character wearing it.	Craft Wondrous Item, stoneskin; Cost 38,000 gp

If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of 6 days, he gains an inherent bonus from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of manual) to his Constitution score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book.

Marvelous Pigments	strong conjuration	15th	-	4,000 gp	-	These pigments enable their possessor to create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the image. One pot of marvelous pigments is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface.  Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can't be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface. It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object with the pigments. Marvelous pigments cannot create magic items. Objects of value depicted by the pigments—precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on—appear to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead, glass, brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item (including foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp. The effect is instantaneous.	Craft Wondrous Item, major creation; Cost 2,000 gp
Mask of the Skull	strong necromancy and transmutation	13th	head 	22,000 gp	3 lbs	This fearsome-looking mask of ivory, beaten copper, or pale wood is typically fashioned into the likeness of a human skull with a missing lower jaw, allowing the bottom half of the wearer's face to remain visible when the mask is worn.  Once per day, after it has been worn for at least 1 hour, the mask can be loosed to fly from the wearer's face. It travels up to 50 feet away from the wearer and attacks a target assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch attack against the target based on the wearer's base attack bonus. If the attack succeeds, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 130 points of damage, as if affected by a finger of death spell. If the target succeeds on his saving throw, he nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of damage. After attacking (whether successful or not), the mask flies back to its user. The mask has AC 16, 10 hit points, and hardness 6.	Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, finger of death, fly; Cost 11,000 gp
Mattock of the Titans	strong transmutation	16th	-	23,348 gp	120 lbs	This digging tool is 10 feet long. Any creature of at least Huge size can use it to loosen or tumble earth or earthen ramparts (a 10-foot cube every 10 minutes). It also smashes rock (a 10-foot cube per hour). If used as a weapon, it is the equivalent of a Gargantuan +3 adamantine warhammer, dealing 4d6 points of base damage.	Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, move earth; Cost 13,348 gp
Maul of the Titans	strong evocation	15th	-	25,305 gp	160 lbs.	This mallet is 8 feet long. If used as a weapon, it is the equivalent of a +3 greatclub and deals triple damage against inanimate objects. The wielder must have a Strength of at least 18 to wield it properly. Otherwise, she takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls	Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, clenched fist; Cost 12,805 gp
Medallion of Thoughts	faint divination	5th	neck	12,000 gp	-	This appears to be a normal pendant disk hung from a neck chain. Usually fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, the medallion allows the wearer to read the thoughts of others, as with the spell detect thoughts.	Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts; Cost 6,000 gp
Mirror of Life Trapping	strong abjuration	17th	-	200,000 gp	50 lbs	This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. The frame typically depicts dragons, demons, devils, genies, coiling nagas, or other powerful creatures that are well known for their magical powers. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).  When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.  If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is destroyed (Hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed.	Craft Wondrous Item, imprisonment; Cost 100,000 gp
Mirror of Opposition	strong necromancy	15th	-	92,000 gp	15 lbs	This item resembles a normal mirror about 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by speaking a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection in the mirror's surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being. This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and its items disappear completely. The mirror functions up to four times per day. Destroying the mirror (Hardness 1, 5 hit points) causes all of the duplicates to immediately vanish	Craft Wondrous Item, clone; Cost 46,000 gp
Necklace of Adaptation 	moderate transmutation	7th	neck	9,000 gp	1 lb	This necklace is a heavy chain with a platinum medallion. The magic of the necklace wraps the wearer in a shell of fresh air, making him immune to all harmful vapors and gases (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, as well as inhaled poisons) and allowing him to breathe, even underwater or in a vacuum.	Craft Wondrous Item, alter self; Cost 4,500 gp
Necklace of Fireballs	moderate evocation	10th	neck (does not take up slot)	1,650 gp (type I), 2,700 gp (type II), 4,350 gp (type III), 5,400 gp (type IV), 5,850 gp (type V), 8,100 gp (type VI), 8,700 gp (type VII)	1 lb	This item appears to be a string of beads, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half).  Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The market price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.

Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed above.  If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer	Craft Wondrous Item, fireball; Cost 825 gp (type I), 1,350 gp (type II), 2,175 gp (type III), 2,700 gp (type IV), 2,925 gp (type V), 4,050 gp (type VI), 4,350 gp (type VII)
Orb of Storms	strong varied	18th	-	48,000 gp	6 lbs	This glass sphere is 8 inches in diameter. The possessor can call forth all manner of weather, even supernaturally destructive storms. Once per day, she can call upon the orb to use a control weather spell. Once per month, she can conjure a storm of vengeance. The possessor of the orb is continually protected by an endure elements effect.	Craft Wondrous Item, control weather, endure elements, storm of vengeance; Cost 24,000 gp
Pearl of Power	strong transmutation	17th	-	1,000 gp (1st), 4,000 gp (2nd), 9,000 gp (3rd), 16,000 gp (4th), 25,000 gp (5th), 36,000 gp (6th), 49,000 gp (7th), 64,000 gp (8th), 81,000 gp (9th), 70,000 gp (two spells)	-	This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a pearl of power enables the possessor to recall any one spell that she had prepared and then cast that day. The spell is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. The spell must be of a particular level, depending on the pearl.

Pearl of the Sirines	moderate abjuration and transmutation	8th	none	15,300 gp	-	This pearl is worth at least 1,000 gp for its beauty alone, yet if it is clasped firmly in hand or held to the breast while the possessor attempts actions related to the pearl's powers, she understands and is able to employ the item.

Phylactery of Faithfulness	faint divination	1st	headband	1,000 gp	-	This item is a tiny box containing religious scripture. The box is affixed to a leather cord and tied around the forehead, worn so that the box sits upon the wearer's brow. There is no mundane way to determine what function this religious item performs until it is worn. The wearer of a phylactery of faithfulnessis aware of any action or item that could adversely affect his alignment and his standing with his deity, including magical effects. He acquires this information prior to performing such an action or becoming associated with such an item if he takes a moment to contemplate the act.

Pipes of Haunting	faint necromancy	4th	-	6,000 gp	3 lbs	This magic item appears to be a small set of pan pipes. When played by a person who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Those within 30 feet who hear the tune must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or become frightened for 4 rounds. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are unaffected. Pipes of haunting can be sounded twice a day	Craft Wondrous Item, scare; Cost 3,000 gp
Pipes of the Sewers	faint conjuration	2nd	-	1,150 gp	3 lbs	If the possessor learns the proper tune, he can use these pipes to attract 1d3 rat swarms if rats are within 400 feet. For each 50-foot distance the rats have to travel, there is a 1-round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10 Perform (wind instruments) check. Success means that they obey the piper's telepathic commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately. The Perform DC increases by +5 for each time the rats have been successfully called in a 24-hour period.  If the rats are under the control of another creature, add the HD of the controller to the Perform check DC. Once control is assumed, another check is required each round to maintain it if the other creature is actively seeking to reassert its control	Craft Wondrous Item, charm animal, summon nature's ally I, wild empathy ability; Cost 575 gp
Pipes of Sounding	faint illusion	2nd	-	1,800 gp	3 lbs	When played by a character who has the Perform (wind instruments) skill, these shiny metallic pan pipes create a variety of sounds. The figment sounds are the equivalent of ghost sound.	Craft Wondrous Item, ghost sound; Cost 900 gp
Portable Hole	strong conjuration	12th	-	20,000 gp	-	A portable hole is a circle of cloth spun from the webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of starlight, resulting in a portable extradimensional space. When opened fully, a portable hole is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains, traveling with the item.  The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth does not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled. Each portable hole opens on its own particular nondimensional space. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the portable hole and bag of holding being destroyed in the process.	Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift; Cost 10,000 gp
Restorative Ointment	faint conjuration	5th	-	4,000 gp	1/2 lb	A jar of this unguent is 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch deep, and contains five applications. Placed upon a poisoned wound or swallowed, the ointment detoxifies any poison (as neutralize poison with a +5 bonus on the check).

Rubbed on a wound, the ointment cures 1d8+5 points of damage (as cure light wounds)	Craft Wondrous Item, cure light wounds, neutralize poison, remove disease; Cost 2,000 gp
Ring Gates	strong conjuration	17th	-	40,000 gp	1 lb each	These always come in pairs—two iron rings, each about 18 inches in diameter. The rings must be on the same plane of existence and within 100 miles of each other to function. Whatever is put through one ring comes out the other, and up to 100 pounds of material can be transferred each day. (Objects only partially pushed through and then retracted do not count.) This useful device allows for instantaneous transport of items or messages, and even attacks. A character can reach through to grab things near the other ring, or even stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could stick his head through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a spell through a ring gate. A Small character can make a DC 13 Escape Artist check to slip through. Creatures of Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine size can pass through easily. Each ring has an “entry side” and an “exit side,” both marked with appropriate symbols	Craft Wondrous Item, gate; Cost 20,000 gp
Robe of the Archmagi	strong varied	14th	body	75,000 gp	1 lb	This normal-appearing garment can be white (01–45 on d%, good alignment), gray (46–75, neither good nor evil alignment), or black (76–100, evil alignment). To most wearers, the robe offers no powers or has no effects unless the wearer's alignment doesn't match that of the robe (see below). Only an arcane spellcaster can fully realize this potent magic item's powers once the robe is donned. These powers are as follows.  +5 armor bonus to AC. Spell resistance 18. +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws. +2 enhancement bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance. As mentioned above, all robes of the archmagi are attuned to a specific alignment. If a white robe is donned by an evil character, she immediately gains three permanent negative levels. The same is true with respect to a black robe donned by a good character. An evil or good character who puts on a gray robe, or a neutral character who dons either a white or black robe, gains two permanent negative levels. While these negative levels remain as long as the garment is worn and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells), they are immediately removed if the robe is removed.	Craft Wondrous Item, antimagic field, mage armor or shield of faith, creator must be of same alignment as robe; Cost 37,500 gp
Robe of Blending	moderate transmutation	10th	body	8,400 gp	1 lb	Once per day this simple wool robe allows you to assume the form of another humanoid creature, as if using alter self. This change lasts for 1 hour, although you can end it prematurely as a free action. While in this form, you also gain the ability to speak and understand the basic racial languages of your chosen form. For example, if you take the form of an orc, you can speak and understand Orc.	Craft Wondrous Item, alter self, tongues; Cost 4,200 gp
Robe of Bones	moderate necromancy [evil]	6th	body	2,400 gp	1 lb	This sinister item functions much like a robe of useful items for the serious necromancer. It appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small embroidered figures representing undead creatures. Only the wearer of the robe can see the embroidery, recognize them for the creatures they become, and detach them. One figure can be detached each round. Detaching a figure causes it to become an actual undead creature (see the list below). The skeleton or zombie is not under the control of the wearer of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked, turned, or destroyed. A newly created robe of bones always has two embroidered figures of each of the following undead:  Human skeleton Wolf skeleton Heavy horse skeleton Fast goblin zombie Tough human zombie Plague ogre zombie	Craft Wondrous Item, animate dead; Cost 1,200 gp
Robe of Eyes	moderate divination	11th	body	120,000 gp	1 lb	This valuable garment appears to be a normal robe until it is put on. Its wearer is able to see in all directions at the same moment due to scores of visible, magical eye-like patterns that adorn the robe. She also gains 120-foot darkvision.  The robe of eyes sees all forms of invisible or ethereal creatures or objects within 120 feet.  The wearer of a robe of eyes gains a +10 competence bonus on Perception checks. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed, and can't be flanked. She is not able to avert or close her eyes when confronted by a creature with a gaze attack.  A light or continual flame spell cast directly on a robe of eyes causes it to be blinded for 1d3 minutes. A daylight spell blinds it for 2d4 minutes.	Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing; Cost 60,000 gp
Robe, Monk's	moderate transmutation	10th	body	13,000 gp	1 lb	This simple brown robe, when worn, confers great ability in unarmed combat. If the wearer has levels in monk, her AC and unarmed damage is treated as a monk of five levels higher. If donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat, the robe lets her make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk (although she does not add her Wisdom bonus to her AC). This ACbonus functions just like the monk's AC bonus.	Craft Wondrous Item, righteous might or transformation; Cost 6,500 gp
Robe of Scintillating Colors	moderate illusion	11th	body	27,000 gp	1 lb	The wearer of this robe can cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of incredible hues, color after color cascading from the upper part of the robe to the hem in sparkling rainbows of dazzling light. The colors daze those near the wearer, conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings. It takes 1 full round after the wearer speaks the command word for the colors to start flowing on the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze attack with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are dazed for 1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting pattern effect.  Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives the wearer better concealment. The miss chance on attacks against the wearer starts at 10% and increases by 10% each round until it reaches 50% (total concealment).  The robe illuminates a 30-foot radius continuously.  The effect can be used no more than a total of 10 rounds per day.	Craft Wondrous Item, blur, rainbow pattern; Cost 13,500 gp
Robe of Stars	strong varied	15th	body	58,000 gp	1 lb	This garment is typically black or dark blue and embroidered with small white or silver stars. The robe has three magical powers.  It enables its wearer to travel physically to the Astral Plane, along with all that she is wearing or carrying. It gives its wearer a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. Its wearer can use up to six of the embroidered stars on the chest portion of the robe as +5 shuriken. The robe grants its wearer proficiency with such weapons. Each shuriken disappears after it is used. The stars are replenished once per month.	Craft Wondrous Item, magic missile, astral projection or plane shift; Cost 29,000 gp
Robe of Usefull Items	moderate transmutation	9th	body	7,000 gp	1 lb	This appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small cloth patches of various shapes. Only the wearer of the robe can see these patches, recognize them for what items they become, and detach them. One patch can be detached each round. Detaching a patch causes it to become an actual item, as indicated below. A newly created robe of useful items always has two each of the following patches:  Dagger Bullseye lantern (full and lit) Mirror (a highly polished 2-foot-by-4-foot steel mirror) Pole (10-foot length) Hempen rope (50-foot coil) Sack In addition, the robe has several other patches. Roll 4d4 for the number of other patches and then roll for each patch on the table below to determine its nature.  d%        Result 01–08        Bag of 100 gold pieces 09–15        Coffer, silver (6 in. by 6 in. by 1 ft.), 500 gp value 16–22        Door, iron (up to 10 ft. wide and 10 ft. high and barred on one side—must be placed upright, attaches and hinges itself) 23–30        Gems, 10 (100 gp value each) 31–44        Ladder, wooden (24 ft. long) 45–51        Mule (with saddle bags) 52–59        Pit, open (10 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft.) 60–68        Potion of cure serious wounds 69–75        Rowboat (12 ft. long) 76–83        Minor scroll of one randomly determined spell 84–90        War dogs, pair (treat as riding dogs) 91–96        Window (2 ft. by 4 ft., up to 2 ft. deep) 97–100        Portable ram Multiple items of the same kind are permissible. Once removed, a patch cannot be replaced	Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate; Cost 3,500 gp
Rope of Climbing	faint transmutation	3rd	-	3,000 gp	3 lbs	A 60-foot-long rope of climbing is no thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other direction at 10 feet per round, attaching itself securely wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner.  A rope of climbing can be commanded to knot or unknot itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are untied, but lowers the DC of Climb checks while using it by 10. A creature must hold one end of the rope when its magic is invoked.	Craft Wondrous Item, animate rope; Cost 1,500 gp
Rope of Entanglement	strong transmutation	12th	-	21,000 gp	5 lbs	A rope of entanglement looks just like any other hempen rope about 30 feet long. Upon command, the rope lashes forward 20 feet or upward 10 feet to entangle a victim. An entangled creature can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check.  A rope of entanglement has AC 22, 12 hit points, hardness 10, and damage reduction 5/slashing. The rope repairs damage to itself at a rate of 1 point per 5 minutes, but if a rope of entanglement is severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed.	Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, animate rope or entangle; Cost 10,500 gp
Salve of Slipperiness	moderate conjuration	6th	-	1,000 gp	-	This substance provides a +20 competence bonus on all Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape from a grapple. The salve also grants a +10 competence bonus to the wearer's Combat Maneuver Defense for the purpose of avoiding grapple attempts. In addition, such obstructions as webs (magical or otherwise) do not affect an anointed individual. Magic ropes and the like do not avail against this salve. If it is smeared on a floor or on steps, the area should be treated as a long-lasting grease spell. The salve requires 8 hours to wear off normally, or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine).  Salve of slipperiness is needed to coat the inside of a container meant to hold sovereign glue.	Craft Wondrous Item, grease; Cost 500 gp
Scabbard of Keen Edges	faint transmutation	5th	-	16,000 gp	1 lb	This scabbard can shrink or enlarge to accommodate any knife, dagger, sword, or similar weapon up to and including a greatsword.

Scarab of Protection	strong abjuration and necromancy	18th	neck	38,000 gp	-	This device appears to be a silver medallion in the shape of a beetle. If it is held for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface letting the holder know that it is a protective device.  The scarab's possessor gains spell resistance 20. The scarab can also absorb energy-draining attacks, death effects, and negative energy effects. Upon absorbing 12 such attacks, the scarab turns to powder and is destroyed.	Craft Wondrous Item, death ward, spell resistance; Cost 19,000 gp
Scarab, Golembane	moderate divination	8th	neck	2,500 gp	-	This beetle-shaped pin enables its wearer to detect any golem within 60 feet, although he must concentrate (a standard action) in order for the detection to take place. A scarab enables its possessor to combat golems with weapons, unarmed attacks, or natural weapons as if those golems had no damage reduction.	Craft Wondrous Item, detect magic, creator must be at least 10th level; Cost 1,250 gp
Silversheen	faint transmutation	5th	-	250 gp	-	This shimmering paste-like substance can be applied to a weapon as a standard action. It gives the weapon the properties of alchemical silver for 1 hour, replacing the properties of any other special material it might have. One vial coats a single melee weapon or 20 units of ammunition.	Craft Wondrous Item; Cost 125 gp
Slippers of Spider Climbing	faint transmutation;	4th	feet	4,800 gp	1/2 lb	When worn, a pair of these slippers enables movement on vertical surfaces or even upside down along ceilings, leaving the wearer's hands free. Her climb speed is 20 feet. Severely slippery surfaces—icy, oiled, or greased surfaces—make these slippers useless. The slippers can be used for 10 minutes per day, split up as the wearer chooses (minimum 1 minute per use).	Craft Wondrous Item, spider climb; Cost 2,400 gp
Sovereign Glue	strong transmutation	20th	-	2,400 gp (per ounce)	-	This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of salve of slipperiness, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the salve of slipperiness must be put in the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of sovereign glue, when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8–1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask's capacity taken up by the salve of slipperiness. One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except when universal solvent is applied to the bond. Sovereign glue is dissolved by universal solvent.	Craft Wondrous Item, make whole; Cost 1,200 gp
Stone of Alarm	faint abjuration	3rd	-	2,700 gp	2 lb	This stone cube, when given the command word, affixes itself to any object.

Stone of Goodluck (Luckstone)	faint evocation	5th	-	20,000 gp	-	This small bit of agate grants its possessor a +1 luck bonus on saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks	Craft Wondrous Item, divine favor; Cost 10,000 gp
Stone Salve	strong abjuration and transmutation	13th	-	4,000 gp	-	This ointment has two uses. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a petrified creature, it returns the creature to flesh as the stone to flesh spell. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a nonpetrified creature, it protects the creature as a stoneskin spell.	Craft Wondrous Item, stone to flesh, stoneskin; Cost 2,000 gp
Strand of Prayer Beads	faint, moderate or strong (many schools)	1st (blessing), 5th (healing), 7th (smiting), 9th (karma), 11th (wind walking), 17th (summons)	-	9,600 gp (lesser), 45,800 gp (standard), 95,800 gp (greater)	1/2 lb	This item appears to be nothing more than a string of prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell while the beads are carried. Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the powers of the prayer beads and understands how to activate the strand's special magical beads. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic power selected from the following list.  Special Bead Type        Special Bead Ability Bead of blessing        Wearer can cast bless. Bead of healing        Wearer can cast his choice of cure serious wounds, remove blindness/deafness, or remove disease. Bead of karma        Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes. Bead of smiting        Wearer can cast chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight (Will DC 17 partial). Bead of summons        Summons a powerful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for 1 day. (If the wearer uses the bead of summons to summon a deity's emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character's items and places a geas upon him as punishment at the very least.) Bead of wind walking        Wearer can cast wind walk. A lesser strand of prayer beads has a bead of blessing and a bead of healing. A strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, and a bead of smiting. A greater strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, a bead of summons, and a bead of wind walking.  Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the bead of summons, which works only once and then becomes nonmagical. The beads of blessing, smiting, and wind walking function as spell trigger items; the beads of karma and summons can be activated by any character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the strand of prayer beads in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person.  The power of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand. Reduce the price of a strand of prayer beads that is missing one or more beads by the following amounts: bead of blessing –600 gp, bead of healing –9,000 gp, bead of karma –20,000 gp, bead of smiting –16,800 gp, bead of summons –20,000 gp, bead of wind walking –46,800 gp.

Sustaining Spoon	faint conjuration	5th	-	5,400 gp	-	If this unremarkable appearing utensil is placed in an empty container, the vessel fills with a thick, pasty gruel.

Unguent of Timelessness	faint transmutation	3rd	-	150 gp	-	When applied to any matter that was once alive, such as wood, paper, or a dead body, this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of time. Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws.
