Weapon Type	Weapon Name	Aura Strenth	Caster Level	Price	Weight	Description	Construction
Club	Beaststrike Club	moderate transmutation	6th	7,300 gp	3 lbs	This +1 club is often decorated with large teeth and carved with stylized images of different animals. As a standard action, the wielder may transform the club into the head or limb of an animal; the weapon's damage does not change but the type of damage changes to suit the shape of the club: bite (piercing), claw (slashing), gore (piercing), slam (bludgeoning), sting (piercing), or talon (slashing). When transformed, the club counts as a natural weapon and a manufactured weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured or natural weapons. The club also counts as the natural weapon of its current shape for the purpose of feats and spells that rely on specific natural weapons, such as Weapon Focus (bite) or the bloody claws spell. If the wielder has the wild shape ability, she can expend one use of wild shape to increase the weapon's damage by one step for the duration of that wild shape as long as the druid remains in contact with the weapon; if the wielder can wild shape at will, the club's damage is always increased in this fashion. If unattended, the club reverts to its normal shape.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shillelagh; Cost 3,800 gp
Greatsword	Blade of Binding	faint conjuration	3rd	12,350 gp	8 lbs	This +1 greatsword is decorated with a chain motif. On a successful hit with the sword against a creature of the wielder's size or smaller creature, the wielder can attempt to start a grapple as a free action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If the wielder succeeds at the grapple, the sword blade transforms into a metal chain and wraps around the target, giving the wielder a +5 bonus on further grapple checks against the target. If the target escapes the grapple or the wielder decides to release the target from the grapple, the chain reverts to sword form (with the wielder holding the handle). The wielder can also let go of the chain's handle while grappling or pinning the target; if so, the chain remains in place and the target gains the entangled condition (Escape Artist DC 20 to slip free, break DC 28, hardness 10, 10 hit points, concentration DC 17 to cast spells while entangled). Another creature can grab the chain's handle as a standard action and will it to revert to sword form as a swift action, which releases the bound creature. If the chain is destroyed, it reverts to sword form and the weapon gains the broken condition.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate rope; Cost 6,350 gp
Mace, heavy	Bolderhead Mace	moderate transmutation	9th	6,812 gp	8 lbs	The head of this +1 heavy mace is made from a single piece of roughly spherical granite. Once per day the wielder can command the mace to release this head, which grows to the size of a Large boulder and rolls quickly in a direction the wielder specifies. The boulder rolls in a straight line up to 60 feet, trampling everything in its path for 3d8+5 damage (Reflex half DC 19). The boulder collapses into rubble and dust at the end of its path or if it encounters an obstacle it cannot break through or roll over, creating a 10-foot-square area of difficult terrain. A new stone mace-head grows on the weapon's haft over the next 24 hours, and it is unusable as a weapon until the head regrows.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, wall of stone; Cost 3,652 gp
Bullets, sling (10)	Dustburst Bullet	faint conjuration	5th	196 gp	1/2 lb	This gritty and irregular +1 sling bullet explodes into a cloud of choking dust when it successfully strikes its target. This fills a 5-foot cube and follows the target for 1d6 rounds before dispersing. Any creature ending its turn in the cloud must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened and blinded for 1 round.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, stinking cloud; Cost 98 gp
Short sword	Guarding Blade	moderate transmutation	15th	65,310 gp	2 lbs	This +1 dancing short sword automatically rises up to defend a fallen or sleeping wielder. To trigger the sword's activation, the wielder must fall unconscious or die while wielding the weapon or holding it in hand. Thereafter, should any creature other than an ally of the wielder attempt to touch or strike him with melee attacks, the sword attacks that creature for up to 4 rounds. After 4 rounds, the weapon drops in the wielder's square. Unless theguarding blade is an intelligent item, it lacks the wits to make decisions about which is the best opponent to attack, and when confronted by multiple opponents attacking the wielder it tends to select a random target each round.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects, mage's faithful hound; Cost 32,810 gp
Lance	Lance of Jousting	faint evocation	5th	4,310 gp	10 lbs	This ornately designed +1 lance streams with ribbons and small favors, allowing a wielder to more effectively knock an opponent from his mount. A successful hit with a lance of jousting on a mounted opponent forces the target to make a Ride check (DC 10 + damage dealt) to avoid being knocked from the saddle. Although used in combat to remove a mounted foe's advantage, use of a lance of jousting in a tournament or similar contest is generally considered a dishonorable form of cheating.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bull's strength; Cost 2,105 gp
Hammer, Light	Ricochet Hammer	moderate transmutation	7th	20,301 gp	2 lbs	This +1 returning light hammer can strike multiple foes with a single throw. If the wielder has multiple attacks from a high base attack bonus, he may throw the hammer so it rebounds off the first target to strike at a second target, and so on for each of the wielder's additional attacks. The distance to each target adds to the total range of the weapon, and range penalties apply. For example, a 6th-level dwarf fighter can throw the hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20 feet away (within one range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets it to a attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from the first target (within three range increments for a –4 range penalty). The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting and has no further attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the returning property. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike) only apply to the first attack and not the others. The ricochet attacks count as the wielder's additional attacks for that round.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, telekinesis; Cost 10,301 gp
Lance	Shieldsplitter Lance	moderate evocation	10th	18,310	10 lbs	This +1 keen lance has the ability to penetrate and destroy shields. Whenever its wielder uses it to successfully strike an opponent who carries a shield, the opponent's shield takes the same damage as the opponent. If the wielder uses the lance to make a sunder attack against a shield, it bypasses the shield's hardness.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, keen edge, shatter; Cost 9,310 gp
Arrows (20)	Searing Arrow	moderate evocation	9th	1,516 gp	-	This +1 flaming arrow continues to burn its target each round, dealing 1d6 fire damage on the attacker's turn for the next 3 rounds. Removing the arrow requires a DC 10 Heal check and prevents any further damage from the arrow (the DC increases to 15 if the target tries to remove the arrow from himself). Removing the arrow destroys it, and it burns up once the 3 rounds pass.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; Cost 758 gp
Arrows (20)	Sizzling Arrow	moderate evocation	9th	1,516 gp	-	This +1 corrosive arrow continues to leak acid onto its target each round, dealing 1d6 acid damage on the attacker's turn for the next 3 rounds. Removing the arrow is a DC 10 Heal check and prevents any further damage from the arrow (the DC increases to 15 if the target tries to remove the arrow from himself). Removing the arrow destroys it, and it dissolves up once the 3 rounds pass.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, acid arrow; Cost 758 gp
Starknife	Sparkwake Starknife	moderate evocation	8th	21,324 gp	3 lbs	A faint trail of sparks marks the passage of this +1 shock starknife whenever it is thrown. Once per day its wielder may throw it so it transforms into an 8d6 lightning bolt (Reflex DC 14 half), returning to its physical form at the end of the bolt's path.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, lightning bolt; Cost 10,824 gp
Dagger	Spirit Blade	moderate abjuration	10th	48,502 gp	1 lbs	This almost transparently thin weapon is often decorated with strange faces and swirling mist. In addition to being a +3 ghost touch dagger, it can castdispel magic once per day	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, dispel magic, plane shift, creator must be 9th level; Cost 24,402 gp
Bolts, crossbow (10)	Tangle Bolt	strong conjuration	12th	226 gp	-	Often etched with images of spider webs or swampy vines, this sickly green +1 seeking bolt transforms into sticky goo when it hits, entangling its target and becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. In addition to the bolt damage, the target is entangled as if it had been hit by a tanglefoot bag	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, true seeing and web or creator must have 5 ranks in Craft (alchemy); Cost 113 gp
Trident	Trident of Stability	faint transmutation	3rd	9,815 gp	4 lbs	The base of this sturdy but tarnished +1 trident has a wide metal bar at the bottom, perfectly situated to serve as a solid footrest or other sort of handle. The bar acts as an immovable rod, except instead of an activation button, the immobility power triggers whenever the wielder places one or both feet on the bar, and ends whenever the wielder is no longer touching the bar with at least one foot. If the wielder remains in place and steps on the bar, he gains a +10 bonus to his CMD when trying to resist efforts to move him. The wielder is always considered braced against oncoming charge attacks. If the wielder is falling, he may step on the bar as an immediate action to halt his fall, though the sudden jolt means he takes falling damage for the current distance fallen.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, levitate; Cost 5,065 gp
Battleaxe	Undercutting Axe	moderate necromancy	9th	23,310 gp	6 lbs	This +1 giant-bane battleaxe feels unusually heavy, as if it were made from something far heavier than mere wood and steel.

It allows the wielder to use a poison effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck.

Short sword	Sun Blade	moderate evocation	10th	50,335 gp	2 lbs	This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a sun blade is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword. Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise,Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack. In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 bastard sword. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and ×3 on a critical hit instead of the usual ×2). The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above his head while speaking a command word. The sun blade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that acts like bright light and affects creatures susceptible to light as if it were natural sunlight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restorationspells) while the sword is wielded.	Craft Magic Arms and Armor, daylight, creator must be good; Cost 25,335 gp
